LEDMatrix library for Particle Photon

Refactored from original codebase to use constructor for runtime initialization, instead of initialization in C++ template.
Matrix multipliers untested, probably do not work.

Once you have downloaded the Zip file, it should be extracted into your Arduino Libraries folder and the folder renamed to "LEDMatrix".

For full instructions see the Wiki.
